**[âœ¨ View the Live Site âœ¨](https://sequoia-hope.github.io/ayab-patterns-webviewer/)**

A modern web viewer for browsing the [AYAB (All Yarns Are Beautiful) pattern collection](https://github.com/AllYarnsAreBeautiful/ayab-patterns).

- **Grid Size Options**: Choose between small, medium, and large grid sizes
- **Sorting**: View patterns in ascending (1â†’408) or descending (408â†’1) order
- **Modal Viewer**: Click any pattern to view it full-size
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Use arrow keys to navigate between patterns in modal view
- **Direct Downloads**: Download individual pattern PNG files
- **GitHub Links**: Quick access to view patterns on the original repository
- **Dark Theme**: Easy-on-the-eyes dark mode interface
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

## File Structure

```
ayab-viewer/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html          # Main HTML structure
â”œâ”€â”€ styles.css          # All styling and responsive design
â”œâ”€â”€ script.js           # Pattern loading and interaction logic
â””â”€â”€ README.md          # This file
```

## How It Works

The viewer loads pattern images directly from the GitHub repository using the GitHub raw content URL:
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AllYarnsAreBeautiful/ayab-patterns/main/StitchWorld/`

No build process or backend is required - it's a pure static site that can be hosted anywhere.

## Local Development

To run the viewer locally:

```bash
# Simple HTTP server (recommended)
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Then visit http://localhost:8000

# Or using Node.js
npx serve

# Or just open the file directly
open index.html
```

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

Want to host your own version? See the [GitHub Pages documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site) for deployment instructions.

## Browser Compatibility

Works in all modern browsers:
- Chrome/Edge (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

## Customization

### Change the Number of Patterns

Edit `script.js` line 2:
```javascript
const TOTAL_PATTERNS = 408; // Change this number
```

### Point to a Different Repository

Edit `script.js` line 1:
```javascript
const REPO_BASE_URL = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/main/FOLDER/';
```

### Customize Colors

Edit CSS variables in `styles.css`:
```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #6366f1;
    --secondary-color: #8b5cf6;
    --bg-color: #0f172a;
    /* ... etc ... */
}
```
