## File Structure

```
ayab-viewer/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html          # Main HTML structure
â”œâ”€â”€ styles.css          # All styling and responsive design
â”œâ”€â”€ script.js           # Pattern loading and interaction logic
â””â”€â”€ README.md          # This file
```

## How It Works

The viewer dynamically loads pattern metadata from the GitHub API and displays images directly from the repository using GitHub's raw content URLs. It discovers all PNG files across all 5 pattern collections automatically.

No build process or backend is required - it's a pure static site that can be hosted anywhere.

## Local Development

To run the viewer locally:

```bash
# Simple HTTP server (recommended)
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Then visit http://localhost:8000

# Or using Node.js
npx serve

# Or just open the file directly
open index.html
```

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

Want to host your own version? See the [GitHub Pages documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site) for deployment instructions.

## Browser Compatibility

Works in all modern browsers:
- Chrome/Edge (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

## Customization

### Point to a Different Repository

Edit the configuration in `script.js`:
```javascript
const REPO_BASE_URL = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/main/';
const API_BASE_URL = 'https://api.github.com/repos/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/contents/';
```

### Add or Remove Collections

Edit the `COLLECTIONS` array in `script.js`:
```javascript
const COLLECTIONS = [
    { name: 'FolderName', displayName: 'Display Name', count: 0 },
    // Add more collections...
];
```
Note: The `count` is for display purposes only - actual patterns are loaded dynamically.

### Customize Colors

Edit CSS variables in `styles.css`:
```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #6366f1;
    --secondary-color: #8b5cf6;
    --bg-color: #0f172a;
    /* ... etc ... */
}
```
